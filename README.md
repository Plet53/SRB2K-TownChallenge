# SRB2K-TownChallenge
Lua addon for SRB2Kart, implements light RPG mechanics for quick, highly variable, combatitive races.

THIS IS NOT A FUNCTIONAL ADDON
Things that should be netvar'd arent, objects aren't built to have spawners yet, and nothing takes actual effect in game.
For all intents and purposes, this code exists as a proof of concept that this could be done.
